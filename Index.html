<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ol>
    <li>12 tablespoons melted Ghee or clarified butter, divided</li>
    <li>¾ cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>⅛ teaspoon table salt</li>
    <li>14 sheets frozen phyllo dough, thawed</li>
    <li>1 ¼ cups whole milk</li>
    <li>¼ cup heavy cream</li>
    <li>5 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon powdered sugar</li>
</ol>

<h3>Directions</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Brush 1 tablespoon butter in bottom and up sides of a 9 1/2-inch deep dish pie plate.</li>

    <li>Combine sugar, cinnamon, and salt in a small bowl.</li>

    <li>Place 1 sheet of phyllo dough on a cutting board or clean work surface; brush butter over 1 side. Carefully scrunch up phyllo by pushing the short sides towards another to create a rope, then loosely wrap into a coil. Place in the center of the prepared baking dish. Repeat with remaining phyllo sheets and butter, placing and forming around the center coil to form a concentric circle, packing them in tightly. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of the spiced sugar mixture on top.</li>

    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>

    <li>While phyllo bakes, heat milk and cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until it just begins to boil. Remove from heat.</li>

    <li>Whisk together eggs, vanilla, and remaining spiced sugar mixture in a bowl; gradually add hot milk, whisking constantly, until combined. Immediately pour spiced milk over phyllo in the baking dish and return to the oven.</li>

    <li>Bake until custard is just set, 20 to 25 minutes. Dust with powdered sugar. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
